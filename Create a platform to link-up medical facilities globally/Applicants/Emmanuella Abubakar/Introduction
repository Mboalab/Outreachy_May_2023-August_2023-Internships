Hi, I am Emmanuella Abubakar, some people call me Manuella. 
I am a Product designer with over 1 year experience and I am zealous about using designs to solve problems and innovate solutions.
I have always loved anything that has to do with computers even before i got into tech. 
I used to code before transitioning into the design space and I am excited about getting an opportunity to use my design skills and learn a new technology to bring my designs to life. 

I am interested in this project because it gives me the opportunity to finally contribute to opensource. I have always wanted to do that but did not know how to go about it as a designer. Also, this project gives me an opportunity to delve into the health-tech space, I have personally seen the adverse effect of bad healthcare, negligence in the health sector and not getting the right information on specialists for certain cases. I would love the opportunity to contribute to reducing the effect of this problem and coming up with a great experience that will give people one less problem to solve when dealing with health issues.

I am anticipating collaboration with great minds in form of the mentors and the interns. I can't wait to learn from the mentors who are experienced in thier fields and other interns that we can learn together.

I am also open to connecting via social media; Twitter: https://twitter.com/manuellabubakar , Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuella-faridat-abubakar/, Behance: https://www.behance.net/manuellabubakar , Dribbble: https://dribbble.com/manuellabubakar
