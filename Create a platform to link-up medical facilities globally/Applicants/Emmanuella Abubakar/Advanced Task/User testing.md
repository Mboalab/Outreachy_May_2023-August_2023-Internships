## Introduction
After the design and the development of the healthcare platform focusing on the patient user story of "Signing up and booking an appointment". The user testing of the app is important at this point to aid in effective iteration based on user feedback. The user testing will help me to gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences by identifying usability issues and understanding user behaviour.

## Tools
- Google sheet
- Recorder
- Github

## Methodology
The process I followed to carry out the user testing are as follows:
- I created a test plan.
- I recruited participants that fit into my target audience.
- I conducted the user testing 
- Analyzed the result 
- Documented the user testing

## Result
### Test plan
The user testing plan can be seen below:
#### Goals and objectives
- Determine if users can successfully create a new account and book an appointment.
- Identify any usability issues or pain points in the account creation and booking appointment process.
- Assess the user experience in terms of ease of use, navigation, aesthetics.
#### Tasks
- Create a new account

- Book an appointment
#### Success metrics
- Completion rate of tasks.
- Number of errors encountered during the process.
- User feedback on; ease of use and user satisfaction with the process.
#### Participants
4 potential users from the patient target audience
#### Testing environement
- A quiet room with a comfortable seating arrangement.
- A mobile device with the healthcare platform prototype.
- I will serve as a moderator to explain the purpose and process of the test to participants and to observe the test.
#### Conducting the Test
- Participants will be asked to complete the tasks while thinking aloud about their experience.
- I will take notes and record the testing session.
#### Feedback Collection
Collection of feedback from participants via a short interview after the testing session.
