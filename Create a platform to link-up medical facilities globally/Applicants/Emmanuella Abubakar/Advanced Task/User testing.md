## Introduction
After the design and the development of the healthcare platform focusing on the patient user story of "Signing up and booking an appointment". The user testing of the app is important at this point to aid in effective iteration based on user feedback. The user testing will help me to gain valuable insights into user behavior and preferences by identifying usability issues and understanding user behaviour.

## Tools

- Recorder
- Github

## Methodology
The process I followed to carry out the user testing are as follows:
- I created a test plan.
- I recruited participants that fit into my target audience.
- I conducted the user testing 
- Analyzed the result 
- Documented the user testing
