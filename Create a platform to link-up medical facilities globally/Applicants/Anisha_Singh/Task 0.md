# Task 0: List of Hospitals
## Objective
The objective of this research is to list down 50 active global hospitals, but not only having specialised in eyes, ears etc but to offer general medical services with co-existing sub-units. Additionally, having 50 active global hospitals could help to reduce the burden on existing healthcare systems in some countries, especially those with limited resources or experiencing a high demand for medical care. By spreading out healthcare services across multiple regions, the workload on healthcare professionals and facilities can be distributed, leading to improved healthcare outcomes for patients.

This research is helpful to provide access to quality healthcare services to people in different parts of the world.
## Discoveries
1. During my research, I found out that some hospitals do not have websites.(these are not included in this list).

2. The US, Switzerland and Norway are some of the most advanced countries when it comes to the field of medicines.

3. There are many charitable global hospitals that provide healthcare services to those in need around the world.
Here are a few examples:

* Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - also known as Doctors Without Borders - is an international humanitarian organisation that provides medical care to people affected by conflict, epidemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies. MSF operates in over 70 countries and provides a range of medical services, including emergency surgery, vaccination campaigns, and treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.

* The Smile Train is a non-profit organisation that provides free cleft lip and palate surgeries to children in developing countries. The organisation partners with local hospitals and medical professionals to provide safe and effective surgeries that can transform the lives of children and their families.

    Website: (https://www.smiletrain.org/)

* Shriners Hospitals for Children is a network of 22 hospitals in the United States, Canada, and Mexico that provides specialised medical care to children with orthopaedic conditions, burns, spinal cord injuries, and cleft lip and palate. Shriners Hospitals for Children provides care regardless of the family's ability to pay and is funded through donations and fundraising events.

* The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is a leading paediatric hospital in the United States that provides a range of specialised medical services to children and families. CHOP also has an extensive research program that aims to develop new treatments and cures for childhood diseases.

* The Aga Khan University Hospital is a non-profit hospital network in Pakistan that provides high-quality healthcare services to patients from all over the country. The hospital offers a range of services, including emergency care, surgery, and treatment for chronic conditions such as cancer and heart disease.

These are just a few examples of charitable global hospitals that are making a difference in the lives of people around the world. There are many more organisations like these that are working tirelessly to provide healthcare services to those in need, regardless of their ability to pay.

The criteria I used to select hospitals include:

* I have kept in mind the authenticity of the Hospitals List.
* Include a small description, specialties, and link to their official websites.
* These Hospitals are well researched in terms of primary care hospitals like PHCs, CHCs, secondary care hospitals like District hospitals and tertiary care hospitals associated with medical colleges.
* Including general hospitals with subdivisions.
* General hospitals with subdivisions.
* Number of Beds.
* Location.


I also ensured that the list covers different regions of the world and includes hospitals from both developed and developing countries.


## Project Tasks Completed
I have completed the following tasks as part of my contributions to this project:
- [x] Researched and compiled a list of 50 active global hospitals with their location, services offered, and links to their websites.
- [x] Organised the data in tabular form to make it easily accessible and understandable.
- [x] Provided a Google Docs link to look for more details.(of each hospital)



## Future Work
The next steps for this project include:
* Will be creating an open source tool and providing a link to access it from anywhere(i.e. Open-source).
* Testing and debugging the tool before providing a link.
* Developing a Flutter app so that Hospitals will be able to sign up and register their services and facilities.
* Developing a user-friendly and easily accessible UI to look for the services that these hospitals have listed.
