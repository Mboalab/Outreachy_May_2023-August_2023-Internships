## <b>Mohamed Ali Ibrahim - Mobile App Developer</b> ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Mohamed Ibrahim and I'm a third-year IT student at JKUAT In Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I have always been passionate about technology and I love to build apps. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and frameworks, and tinkering with different technologies.

I'm thrilled to be participating in Outreachy and to be contributing to the world of open source software. I believe that open source is an incredibly powerful force for good in the tech industry, and I'm excited to be a part of it.

I know that contributing to open source projects can be challenging, but I'm eager to learn and to collaborate with others. I believe that by working together, we can create amazing things and make a real difference in the world.

I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and to learning from your experiences. Let's make this Outreachy journey a memorable and rewarding one!
