# Task 0: 50 Hospital globally.

### Researching Global Hospitals

<br>

## Objective:  

Knowing which hospitals are open both locally and globally is crucial for connecting hospitals. In this sense, the term "hospitals" refers to all medical facilities.
The hospitals ought to be general healthcare facilities where the many sub-units coexist rather than being highly specialized ones like eye or ear hospitals.

## Research Plan

- Global hospitals are hospitals that provide healthcare services across different countries and regions.
- Healthcare delivery systems vary across different countries, and healthcare outcomes can be affected by factors like political instability, cultural differences, and social issues.
- Some countries/regions are known for providing high-quality healthcare services, such as UAE, the United Kingdom, and european hospitals, so i carefully structured both well recognized hospitals and less known.

## Problem faced during resarch

Limited availability of information: Some hospitals might not have an online presence or may not provide detailed information about their services and facilities.
