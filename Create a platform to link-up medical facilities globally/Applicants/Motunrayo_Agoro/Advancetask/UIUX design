Project Description
The goal of this design is to show how the app will look like and what functions will be in the mobile app. I designed for the first target which is the “Patients” in which they can come on the app to perform certain interaction on the app to achieve their goal concerning their health 

Patient scenario
Here is a scenario description of the app to help who ever go through this project understand how the app would work in the future after the design has been implemented, they are listed below;
User signs up on the App
After signing, a detailed question about user personal data is asked
Next, user gives information  about medical history ( this information will be used by the app to generate possible medical facilities based on the information given)
Next is the homepage that has the search bar, hospital based on users information and also location, then other important features
User can either search for hospitals based on filter or click on what the app brings
After user clicks on what the brings, a screen showing information about the hospital pops up with two functions to “book an appointment” or “chat with a representative”
User can either know more about the hospital by clicking on “view more”
User then choose to talk to a representative to ask more about the hospital and also ask about time user can schedule appointment
User go back to the hospital page and click on “schedule an appointment”
User then chose available time and date for appointment
User gets notification when messages comes in or to remind appointment
User click on profile on the homepage 
User can switch on language translator, so that whatever message comes in will be automatically in language users preferes 

The design screens are
The splash screen
The signup and login screens
The personal data input screen
Medical history input screens
Home screen

Other targeted users can be added  later to the UIUX of the design
