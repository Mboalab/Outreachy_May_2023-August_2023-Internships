I am Joseph Sa-Ambo, an optometry student and UI/UX Designer from Ghana who is passionate about making a difference in the world of healthcare and technology.

With a keen eye for design and a heart for service, I am excited to contribute my skills to MboaLab's project aimed at creating a platform to link medical facilities globally. I am ready to learn from everyone on the project, as I do not know everything.

As a student of optometry, I understand the importance of access to quality healthcare, especially in underserved areas and with my expertise in UI/UX design, I am eager to help create a platform that will connect medical facilities around the world, making it easier for patients to access the care they need, no matter where they are.
