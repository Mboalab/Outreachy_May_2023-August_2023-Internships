## Hospital Data Collection Tool


**Introduction**

The purpose of this project was to create an appropriate data collection tool for hospitals and health facilities to sign-up on to an inter-connected platform for global facilities. The tool was developed to aid in the collection of data that would enable us create a suitable platform that links medical facilities globally and make it easier for people to access the medical services they need.

**Research Methodology**

The first step in the project was to identify the type of data that was required for collection. This was done by conducting research and consulting with healthcare practitioners online and from my country Ghana. From my research, I gathered the most important information that would be sufficient enough to provide a clear and accurate description of the hospital.

**Creation of the Tool**


The name of the software used in creating the tool is Google Forms, which is a survey creation software part of the Google Workspace and it was chosen because of its wide potential of use, ease of share, and no cost at all, as against other software/websites like Formstack, Typeform, Microsoft Forms, Jotform and ClickUp. The tool was designed to capture key hospital data like:

* Hospital Name 
* Category of Hospital (General-purpose, Teaching Hospital, Specialized clinic (like an Eye Clinic), Acute care Facility, Long-term Hospital, Research Hospital, Birth Center, Blood bank, Hospice home, Imaging center, Rehabilitation Center, & more)
* Location (Country, City, Region, State, Province, Postal Code)
* Opening days and hours 
* Services Offered (Oncology, Surgery, etc.)
* Facilities Available (X-ray, Laboratory, etc.)
* Availability of Ambulances, Blood bank etc)
* Estimated Number of Beds
* Website 
* Contact Information (Phone, Email)
**




The form was designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate and the questions were formulated in such a way that they would easily elicit the required information from the respondents. The method of data collection via the tool was meant to be both remote (to be filled online) and on-site (for hospitals located in the area where the project would be implemented).

**Testing**


The next step was to test the form to ensure that the form was functioning as expected and this involved testing the form with a small group of healthcare staff and making necessary adjustments based on their feedback.

**Additional features for a good User Experience**


A good introductory description of the form and what is expected of respondents.

An appreciation message to thank the respondents for taking time to provide the information.

Sections to guide the respondents and adequately group the information.

An “any other relevant information” section where respondents can provide any key information about their hospital which may not have been included in the form.

A suggestion/feedback section where respondents can give some feedback.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the aim of the task was achieved in successfully creating a tool for the collection of data from health facilities using Google Forms. The tool was proven effective in collecting important health data that will aid in the creation of a suitable platform that links medical facilities globally and make it easier for people to access the medical services they need.
