Developing screens for MedLink+ was a very challenging task for me since it was my first time trying out coding properly. I used Figma, a popular design tool with which I am quite proficient, to design the screens and Flutter, an open-source programming framework for mobile app development.

As a designer who is new to Flutter, the journey to create screens for MedLink+ has been an exciting learning experience. Even though learning new skills can be daunting, I have found it rewarding, as it has broadened my knowledge of design and technology.

In the beginning, the designer started by researching the requirements for MedLink+. This involved analyzing the various features and functionalities the application needed to have, such as user authentication, a dashboard to display hospital data, and a chat function to communicate with other hospitals. With this information in mind, the designer proceeded to create the screens in Figma. The screens were designed to be simple, user-friendly, and consistent with the MedLink+ brand.

A friend of mine who is knowledgeable in Flutter took time to teach me a lot about Flutter and this made the learning process more manageable. He started with basic concepts like how to create widgets, add buttons and text fields, and customize colors and fonts. With each new concept learned, I tried to apply it in and produce the screens just as they looked in Figma.

Although I am not fully done with the screens, I am determined to complete them on time even after the deadline. I have come to see Flutter as a valuable tool that I can use to further enhance my skills and become a better tech person.
