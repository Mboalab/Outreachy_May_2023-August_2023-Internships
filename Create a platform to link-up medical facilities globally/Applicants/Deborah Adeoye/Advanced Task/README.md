# Link-Up Hospital Application

## Hello and welcome to the beginning of my solution to the advanced task!

I'm **Deborah**, and this file will take you through my contribution process.
To actively carry out this task in a timely manner, I am breaking it down into subtasks, so as to update everyone on my contributions. Each subtask includes:

- [x] Understanding the requirements, identifying the key features of the MVP and the scope of the application. This will also include user research, user personas, & user stories.
- [x] Planning my design, considering the user interface, navigation, and layout of each screen. Here, I'll sketch out my ideas and create wireframes to guide my design process.
- [ ] Creating a prototype. I'll be using figma (as it's the only software I'm conversant with) to visualize my design.
- [ ] Developing the application. This will be my first time ever using Flutter to develop an application. I'll try to implement the design and features I had planned, keeping in mind the MVP requirements.
- [ ] Testing my proposed application: I'll simply be checking for bugs and issues, and make any necessary fixes.
