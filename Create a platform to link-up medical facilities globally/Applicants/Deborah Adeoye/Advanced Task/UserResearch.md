# Link-Up Hospital Application Research Documentation

## User Research: Summary
I conducted a secondary research to better understand the needs of hospitals and healthcare providers in regards to linking up with other healthcare institutions.
Through interviews and surveys, it became clear that many healthcare providers are open to the idea of linking up with other institutions to improve patient care and outcomes.<br>
However, the majority of providers reported feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about how to go about this process. Feedback received through research made it clear that users would be more willing to actively seek out and engage in partnerships if they had access to an easy-to-use tool that guides them through the process of finding and connecting with other healthcare institutions.

## Key Features
Based on the given objective, the application is intended to link up hospitals. In lieu to this, here are some potential key features of the MVP. These are:
* A searchable directory of hospitals
* Hospital profiles with basic information such as name, location, services offered, and contact details
* A messaging system to facilitate communication between hospitals

Since this is a proposal, more potential features can be added to guide the design.

The scope of the application will also be limited to these key features and any necessary supporting features (e.g. user authentication, data storage) to make the application functional.

## User Stories
From on the user personas and their needs, I was able to generate user stories to clearly define the functionality and features of the application:
1. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to search for other hospitals in my area so that I can collaborate with them on medical issues.
2. As a **hospital staff member**, I want to be able to update our hospital's information on the app so that other hospitals can be aware of our services and facilities.
3. As a **patient**, I want to be able to search for hospitals based on specific medical services they provide so that I can find the best hospital for my needs.
4. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to view other hospitals' information on the app so that I can assess their suitability for potential collaborations.
5. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to send messages to other hospitals on the app so that we can communicate and collaborate effectively.
6. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to filter my search results by location, services offered, and facilities available so that I can find the most suitable hospital for collaboration.
7. As a **hospital administrator**, I want to be able to see the rating and reviews of other hospitals on the app so that I can make an informed decision about potential collaborations.
8. As a **hospital staff member**, I want to be able to access a directory of medical professionals on the app so that I can easily refer patients to the appropriate specialists.
