# Hospital Data Collection Tool

## Introduction
This task aims to create a data collection tool for hospitals to sign-up for a system remotely and onsite. The tool will collect necessary information about the hospital, including name, location, services offered, facilities available, and other relevant information. I will document the processes involved in completing this task, from identifying the key information needed to monitoring and updating the tool.

## Identification of Key Information Needed
Before creating the data collection tool, I identified the key information that would be required from hospitals during sign-up. This information includes:
* Hospital Name
* Location (Country, City, Postal Code)
* Services Offered (General Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, etc.)
* Facilities Available (Laboratory, Radiology, Pharmacy, etc.)
* Number of Beds
* Contact Information (Phone, Email)


## Choosing the Format of the Data Collection Tool
I decided to use Google Forms as the format for the data collection tool as it allows for easy collection and organization of data, both remotely and onsite. Google Forms also provides an easy-to-use interface for the hospitals to input their information.

## Creating the Data Collection Tool
The data collection tool was created using Google Forms, with the necessary fields for collecting the key information identified earlier. The form was designed with sections and subsections to make it easier for hospitals to input their information and for the system administrators to organize the collected data.


## Confirmation Message for Successful Form Submission
Once the hospital submits their form, they will receive a confirmation message indicating that their submission has been successful. The message will thank them for their submission and let them know that the system administrator will review their application and respond to them shortly.

## Monitoring and Updating the Data Collection Tool
The data collection tool will be monitored regularly to ensure that it is functioning properly and that all submissions are being recorded accurately. Any necessary updates or changes to the form will be made promptly to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the hospitals and the system administrators.

## Conclusion
This task has successfully created a data collection tool for hospitals to sign-up for a system remotely and onsite. The tool collects necessary information about the hospital, including name, location, services offered, facilities available, and other relevant information. By using Google Forms, the tool provides an easy-to-use interface for hospitals to input their information, and the system administrators to organize the collected data. The data collection tool will be monitored and updated regularly to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the hospitals and the system administrators.
