Hello everyone,

My name is **Deborah Adeoye** from Nigeria, and I am excited to introduce myself as a new Outreachy Contributor, eager to contribute to the open source community.

As a female product designer and learning software engineer, I am passionate about using technology to create solutions that improve people's lives, and I believe that open source is a powerful tool for achieving this goal.

I am particularly interested in telemedicine, which has become increasingly important in today's world, where access to healthcare services is often limited or difficult.
I believe that technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we deliver and receive medical care, and I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to this field.

Through my participation in Outreachy, I hope to not only develop my own skills as a designer, but also to contribute to meaningful open source projects that make a positive impact on people's lives.
I am excited to collaborate with other developers and designers, learn from experienced mentors, and make meaningful contributions to the open source community.

For any one open to connecting with me before, duting or after the internship, I can always be reached through my socials:
