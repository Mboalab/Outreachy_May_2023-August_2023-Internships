## Task 1: Data Collection Tool

#### APPROACH ->

- I created a data collection tool using React.js and its libraries which include Formik and Yup.

- Formik is designed to manage forms with complex validation with ease. It comes with baked-in support for schema-based form-level validation through Yup.

- By analyzing and researching, I created the forms with these below-mentioned fields which will help patients before visiting the hospital.

  - Data fields for hospital information: hospital name, address, phone number, email address, website URL, and other relevant contact information.

  - Services and specialties: Services and specialties they offer, such as emergency room, intensive care unit, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, cardiology, neurology, oncology, orthopedics, rehabilitation, and mental health.

  - Facilities and amenities: As mentioned, the tool should indicate the facilities and amenities they have on-site, such as parking, cafeteria, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, blood bank, and ambulance service.

  - Insurance: It is a main concern of the patients so a field is mentioned for insurance.

  - Additional information: A box of additional information that may be relevant, such as the number of beds, accreditation information, or patient satisfaction scores.

  - Data validation: The tool is built by considering data validation to ensure that the information being collected is accurate and complete.

- I made a logo with the name **MboaLab** which is at the right-down corner. It is used just for the form as of now.

- The form is responsive and functional. The data collected through the form is visible at the console which is represented in a easy way as possible.

- Every field has some conditions. Like minimum letters, required filed, Must be a URL only, Must be a mail,includes _others_ as a checkbox option and a text area at the end, for additional information.

- I have added a video, Please have a look.
