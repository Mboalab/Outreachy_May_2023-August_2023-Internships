<p>Hi,ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ishita Kapoor, an aspiring Software Developer. Currently, with 1+ year of experience in web development and app development.

Finding creative solutions to problems is something I have always enjoyed. As a kid, I loved watching Marvel movies and especially Tony Stark's character. The way he invented new sci-fi suits and weapons blew my mind off and inspired me to take my life to a new horizon.
Hence, I am constantly working on innovative projects.</p>
