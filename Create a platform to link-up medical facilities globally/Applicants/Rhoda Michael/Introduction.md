## About Me
I am Rhoda Michael, an outreachy applicant from Nigeria.

I've always been enthusiastic about health tech and this is why I'm excitedly looking forward to contributing to MboaLab's project aimed at creating a platform to link medical facilities globally.

I love referring to myself as a techie and my passion and key competencies are User Experience Design, User Research, content and technical writing.

I also have experience using webflow, creating visual designs, and I'm a mental health advocate.
