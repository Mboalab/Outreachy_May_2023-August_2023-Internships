HI. My name is Nuibim Lewin from Cameroon, specifically the Northwest Region. 

I am a UI/UX designer. Ive been into UI/UX for abut 2 years now, and when I learnt about the Outreachy internship, I was stoked to have found a place to help me prove and improve my skills in design development. 

The thing that pushed me into devopment in the fist place was becuase I am a sickle cell patient, and I noticed that they were very few applications available that focused on the health, wellbeing and management of sickle cell and sickle cell patients like myself. And after losing a brother to the disease, that was the last straw. 

So with that as motivation, I decided to learn how to create and design applications, and with the help of my brother and friends we made our very first build.

I want to thank the outreachy management and Mboalab for this once in a lifetime oppurtunity, and I hope to be very useful. Thank you.
