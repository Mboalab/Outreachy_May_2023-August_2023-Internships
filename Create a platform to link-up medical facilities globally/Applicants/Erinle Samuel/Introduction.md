My name is Erinle Samuel. I am a Software developer from Nigeria. I have great enthusiasm for health and tech. I love building and supporting projects that align with SDG 3rd goal- _health and well-being for all._

I have experience building web and mobile apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Reactjs, Dart and Flutter. I am a technical writer and an open-source enthusiast. I also have experience in the medical research field, and Iâ€™m willing to put all my skills into contributing to Mboalab.
