# Link-up Hospital Application - Design

The goal of creating an application that link-up medical facilities globally is to reduce mortality rate, by providing access to information about hospitals globally. In order to come up with an MVP, I used two scenarios.

## Case Studies

- A fatal accident happened in a farmland and the local area hospital is far from where it happened. The eye-witnesses didn't have any option than to take the victims there. Before they could get there, a victim gave up the ghost. It was later discovered that there was a private hospital nearby.
- A 50 year-old woman was admitted into a hospital with kidney failure. Dialysis was carried out by the doctors in charge and various tests were carried out immediately. Results of tests revealed that there may be tumours on both kidneys, and the patient needs immediate medical attention. However, the hospitals doesnt offer oncology/cancer care service. They have to search for hospitals to refer her to in the next 12 hours or she might not survive it.

The victim that died could have been saved if there was an app that could the witnesses could use to search for nearby hospitals. Also, while rushing victims, if hospitals are alerted, they would be able to prepare for the emergency.

Also, the hospital where the 50 year-old woman was admitted could have had a lot of hospitals to choose from if there was an app they could use to see available hospitals that offers oncology services. They would also be able to contact the available hospitals, so they can make further enquiries.

### Features of the MVP

These case studies made me come up with features that would qualify as a minimum viable product. These features include,

- List of all hospitals and information about them, including facilities and services offered.
- A call now and visit website feature on each hospital information.
- Hospitals around me.
- Specialist Hospitals
- Hospitals offering emergency services.
- A search feature to lookup a particular hospital.
- Others

## Design

I was able to come up with eight screens including three pages to onboard users(onboarding, signup and login pages).

## What I learnt

This is my first time coming up with a product design. I have put in my best and would really love to improve on it. I learnt the following

- Basics of user experience
- User empathy
- How to come up with a minimum viable product
- Color Rules
- How to use figma
