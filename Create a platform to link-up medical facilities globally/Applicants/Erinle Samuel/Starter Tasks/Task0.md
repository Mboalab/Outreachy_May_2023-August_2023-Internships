# List of Hospitals

## Task Objective

In order to create a platform that links-up medical facilities globally, it is necessary to be aware of which medical facility or hospital is operational. The aim of this task is to make a list of 50 researched operational hospitals around the world. These hospitals/medical facilities must however, not be specialized (as in specialist hospitals), but rather provide general medical services- where a specialty is a subunit.

### Completed Activities

- [x] Research and create a list of 50 global hospitals.

- [x] Take into consideration their location, services offered and links to their websites.

- [x] Hospitals must not be specialized

## Methods

Lists of hospitals were obtained from reliable sources, like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). However, services of each hospital were obtained from their websites for reliability. Attention was focused on making sure that medical facilities selected are not specialized. In this data, hospitals/medical facilities with at least 100 bed-spaces were only selected.
Also, medical facilities were selected based on region. Nearly an equal number of hospitals were selected from Africa,Australia, America, Asia and Europe.

**I have also compiled this list in a spreadsheet. It is accessible at: [Erinle Samuel-Task0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jje07y97Hvdfhb3VNCKqTx0aFCMuWRkgSHamsLcGr9c/edit?usp=sharing)**

## Observation

In order to enhance accessibility to information, and provide comprehensive data, it is imperative to group services into specialties and subspecialties, which is what I did in Task1.md.

**NB:** All information in this list were obtained from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and the hospitals' websites. However, names of hospitals were gotten from many other websites like;
