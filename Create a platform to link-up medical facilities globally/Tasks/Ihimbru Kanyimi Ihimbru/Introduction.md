My name is Ihimbru Kanyimi, a third year Computer Engineering student in the School of Engineering of Bamenda, Cameroon. 
My interests are mobile app development with flutter and kotlin, backend development with Kotlin-spring boot and UI/UX design with figma.
I am very good at working with teams and I will do my best to contribute to this open source project of creating a platform to link up medical facilities globally.
