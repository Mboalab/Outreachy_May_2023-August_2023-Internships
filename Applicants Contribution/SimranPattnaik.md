# _Self Introduction_

### Greetings🙋‍♀️

**_I am Simran Pattnaik, a 3rd-year undergraduate in Information Technology from India. I have been developing android apps using Flutter for two years, and my latest project includes integrating Machine Learning models with my Flutter apps.
Apart from Flutter, I have a firm grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms and have foundational knowledge in Operating Systems, DBMS, computer networking, and model checking._**

**The Mboalab projects fascinate me as I would get to work with the latest technologies while also contributing to social good. I'm excited to contribute my best to elevate the projects and bond with the community.**

**I am looking forward to having a great time contributing! 🙌**
