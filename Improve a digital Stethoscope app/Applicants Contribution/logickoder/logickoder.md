<p>I am Jeffery Orazulike, a passionate and creative mobile developer who loves solving problems with code.</p>
<p>I have been developing Android apps using Java/Kotlin and Flutter for over two years, and I have built several projects that showcase my skills and interests. 
Some of them are qrpay, a QR code payment app; expense-manager, a simple app to organize expenses; currency-calculator, an app that converts currencies using live rates; and rhapsave, an app that helps users save money for their goals.</p>
<p>I am also a finalist of HNG Internship 8, where I learned how to work under pressure and collaborate with other developers remotely. 
In my spare time, I enjoy tweeting about various topics such as technology, politics and religion.</p>
