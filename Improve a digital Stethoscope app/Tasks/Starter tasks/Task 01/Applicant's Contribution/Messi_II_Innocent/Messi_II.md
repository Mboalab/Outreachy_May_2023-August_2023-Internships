## Greetings to the MBOALAB,

        I'm called Messi II Innocent Rostand, a software engineer from Cameroon,University of Buea precisely F.E.T(Faculty of Engineering and Technology).
I am a skilled software engineer with a passion for JavaScript and Dart. With some pretty good knowledge in React Native and Flutter development,
I am able to create cross-platform mobile applications that are both efficient and user-friendly. 
My background in graphic design in which I'm still a beginner also allows me to create visually
appealing user interfaces that enhance the user experience. 

        As a tech enthusiast, I am always seeking out new technologies and trends to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-changing tech industry.
My diverse skill set and ability to adapt to different technologies make me a valuable asset to any team and also looking forth to keep learning especially with the projects provided by the MBOALAB Community.
