
## Introduction
Greetings, my name is Nitya Pasrija, and I am a sophomore pursuing a specialization in IT at IGDTUW, India. My proffesional experience includes working with both ML and Flutter technologies, independently. However, I am keen on exploring how these technologies can be integrated together to create more robust and efficient solutions.

In pursuit of this goal, I am eager to apply to the Outreachy program with MboaLab, as I believe it will provide me with an excellent opportunity to develop my skills and further enhance my expertise in this field. I look forward to the prospect of contributing to the organization's mission and learning from the team.
