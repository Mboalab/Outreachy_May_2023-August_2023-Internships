Hello, my name is Emmilly Immaculate Namuganga, i am an Android developer living in Uganda.I have been using flutter and kotlin to develop android 
applications for close to 2 years now.

This is my first time contributing to open source projects and i am very excited  for this opportunity to showcase and improve my skills.

I chose this project because it matches my skills and i believe will also challenge me. I have interacted with ML before when i worked on an ML application that was using images to diagnose poultry diseases.It involved picking images 
from gallery and the camera and sending them to a model which was hosted on microsoft azure to classify it 
and send back the results which were displayed to the user on the application.

I love volunteering and i am excited about the possibility of contributing to **Improve-a-digital-Stethoscope-app** during my 
internship and can't wait to experience working with voice in ML.
