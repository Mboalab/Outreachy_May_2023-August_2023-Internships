
## Introduction
My name is Nitya Pasrija, and I am a sophomore specializing in IT at IGDTUW in India. My professional experience includes working independently with both ML and Flutter technologies. I am particularly interested in exploring how these technologies can be integrated to create more robust and efficient solutions.

I am excited to apply to the Outreachy program with MboaLab because I believe it will provide me with an exceptional opportunity to develop my skills and further enhance my expertise in this field. MboaLab's ambitious mission to empower people through technology resonates with me, and I am eager to contribute to the organization's efforts in any way I can. Looking forward to the opportunity to learn and grow with the MboaLab team.
