<br>
I am Nikhila K S, a computer science undergraduate from India, currently in my second year of studies. <br>
If I were to describe myself, I'd say that I am an enthusiastic individual, always eager to learn and explore new things. With a versatile skill-set and a high level of integrity, I am committed to going the extra mile to ensure tasks are completed before the deadline. I pride myself on being a good team player while also having the ability to work independently.

When I came across the "Improve-a-digital-Stethoscope-app" project, I knew it was something that aligned perfectly with my skillset and for a good cause. I feel privileged to have found this amazing MboaLab community through Outreachy and cannot wait to collaborate and learn from the brightest minds in this field. I am looking forward to discussing my ideas and participating in the advanced tasks with the community.<br>
