I am Sumaya Ahmed Salihs. I am Ghanaian by nationality. I have been using flutter for two years now. I have used it to build two health applications. I have a soft spot for health solutions or application. 

It was really enlightening to know the motivation behind the digital stethoscope app, I never knew the purchase of a stethoscope was among the concerns faced by medical institutions in low- and middle-income countries. I look forward to working with the community who work on this vital product, this includes the mentors Jafsia Elisee and Ruqaiya Sattar.

I have never used ML on any of the application I have worked on in the past hence looking forward to leveraging it on this project. It has been awhile since I used any ML tool hence I am really excited to go back to it and use it accordingly to contribute to this project.
