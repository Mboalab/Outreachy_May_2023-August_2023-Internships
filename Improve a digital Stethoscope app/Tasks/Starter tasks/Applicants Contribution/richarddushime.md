Hi there! My name is **Dushime Mudahera Richard**, and I'm an Outreachy applicant who successfully passed the initial application stage. I'm excited for the contribution period and am particularly interested in Mboalab Projects, specifically the Open Pay project - an open-source payment technology for small change scarcity.

Aside from my interest in this project, I'm also passionate about open science, cybersecurity, Android development, data science, and machine learning. In my free time, I like to work on computer hardware as well. I believe that working on this project will not only allow me to enhance my skills but also acquire new knowledge in the technologies used.

I am open to learning new technologies and am flexible in my approach. I enjoy automating things and having fun while working. I look forward to working with the concerned mentors to successfully implement this project.
