Hi,

My name is Dhruv Gupta. I am a Flutter and a web developer from India. I have a keen interest in flutter development. I felt excited when I saw a project related to flutter i.e. MBOALABS. I like to participate in hackathons and create solutions for social good.

This will be my first time that I will be contributing into an international project. I will be learning many new things for sure.

In this contribution phase, I will be contributing in Stethoscope App project.

Looking forward to connect and work under the guidance of respective mentors (Ruqaiya).
