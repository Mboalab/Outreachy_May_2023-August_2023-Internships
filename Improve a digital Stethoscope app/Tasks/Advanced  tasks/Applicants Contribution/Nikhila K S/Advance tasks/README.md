# Advance Tasks
Greetings,<br>
I'm excited to share some updates I've made. <br>
### 🔸Advance task- Implementation of Audio recording and recorded audio player
I've completed an advanced task of adding an audio recorder and recorded audio player to the app. <br>
When the mic button is pressed, a toast message appears indicating that recording has started. To stop the recording, the mic button is clicked again, and a toast message indicating that recording has stopped appears.Ripple effect is added to the mic. I have also implemented the delete functionality. On clicking the delete button recording will be deleted and toast message will appear “recording deleted”.<br>

<br>Currently, the recording is saved in local storage, but it can be improved by using Database. <br>
### 🔸I've added an app icon to enhance its visual appeal.
