# Advance task- Implementation of Audio recording and recorded audio player
I've completed the advanced task of recording one's voice and playing/pausing the recorded file on the app. <br>
When the mic button is pressed, the button turns red indicating that recording has started and a wave form appears with time elapsed. To stop the recording, the mic button is clicked again and it's color turns back to blue indicating that recording has stopped. <br>
