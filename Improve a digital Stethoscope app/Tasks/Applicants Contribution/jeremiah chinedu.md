## Flutter Developer

My name is Jeremiah Chinedu, I am a Flutter developer with a passion for creating beautiful and high performing mobile apps. I graduated with a degree in computer science from Nnamdi Azikiwe University, and I have spent the last two years learning and building mobile apps with Flutter. In my free time, I enjoy taking pictures of myself for my social media handles.

As someone who's always had a passion for building mobile apps and open source, I'm excited to contribute to the Digital Stethoscope app.
