## Task 1 : Introduction

Hello!ðŸ‘‹

I am Mugdha Pendse (she/her), a final-year undergrad student. My interest and experience lies in the domains of machine learning, AI, app development, and UI/UX. 

The project, "Mboalab's Digital Stethoscope App" feels extremely welcoming. I am excited to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to a project, that shares the same beliefs as mine and aims to make healthcare more accessible and affordable to all!
