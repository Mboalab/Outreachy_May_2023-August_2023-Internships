## Introduction:
From the famous M-Pesa in East Africa to Flutterwave in Nigeria, there is a need for a virtual payment method that Africa as a whole can adapt to. I am particulary passionate about the Cyber Security aspect of it since most Africans, especially where I come from want to feel the money they have with their physical hands. However, with the evolving world, the talk of vitual money is becoming more and more appealing to our society. 

## Is Payment technology for small change scarcity a worthy reserach: 
>**'Make single or bulk transfers to bank accounts from your Flutterwave dashboard.'**  
>**'M-PESA is a mobile phone-based money transfer service...'**

It is easy to assume that from the above two statements from the commonly known mobile money agents in East and West Africa, the gap in the market for an Open Source Payment technology for small change scarcity has been filled, but I beg to differ. Most of these applications do not neccesarily have the capability for day to day/ small tranfers use. You do find that you are using more money in the long run cause of the many charges while tranfering, and that is why I think there is definatily a gap in the market for a Payment technology for small change.
